Hachi - Wi-Fi Security Testing Tool
Overview
Hachi is an ethical Wi-Fi security testing tool designed to help network administrators identify and fix vulnerabilities in their Wi-Fi networks. Hachi provides a range of features, from network scanning to password cracking, empowering users to enhance network security.

Disclaimer
Hachi is intended only for authorized testing on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal and unethical. The developers are not responsible for any misuse.

Features
Tool Installation: Easily install all required dependencies for network testing.
Network Adapter Detection: Detects and lists available Wi-Fi adapters.
Wi-Fi Scanning: Identifies nearby networks (SSIDs and BSSIDs) and optionally displays hidden networks.
Packet Capture: Captures packets for a specific Wi-Fi network to analyze potential vulnerabilities.
Custom Wordlist Creation: Enables users to create personalized wordlists for password cracking.
Password Cracking Options:
CPU Cracking: Uses Aircrack-ng with a wordlist for cracking.
GPU Cracking: Leverages Hashcat for faster processing.
Custom Input Cracking: Generates and tests passwords using custom character sets and masks.
Detailed Reporting: Organizes and displays networks and vulnerabilities in a user-friendly format.
Requirements
Operating System: Linux-based OS (e.g., Kali Linux, Ubuntu)
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
scapy
colorama
Tools: aircrack-ng, hashcat, airodump-ng
Install dependencies via:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng hashcat
pip install scapy colorama
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/abdalmajeed77/hachi.git
cd hachi
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
sudo python3 hachi.py
Follow the interactive menu:

Option 1: Install required tools.
Option 2: List available network adapters.
Option 3: Scan for Wi-Fi networks.
Option 4: Capture packets for a specific network.
Option 5: Create a wordlist for password cracking.
Option 6-9: Crack passwords using different methods.
Usage Examples
Scanning Networks
Select your network adapter.
Choose whether to display hidden networks.
View scanned SSIDs and BSSIDs.
Cracking Passwords
Use a custom wordlist or generate one.
Select CPU (Aircrack-ng) or GPU (Hashcat) for faster processing.
Use advanced custom input masks for brute-force attempts.
